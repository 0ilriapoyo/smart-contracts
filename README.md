The practice of dubbing Hollywood movies in Hindi has been going on for decades, and it has become a lucrative business for both the Hollywood studios and the Indian distributors. According to a report by KPMG India, the dubbed versions of Hollywood movies accounted for 13% of the total Hollywood box office revenue in India in 2019. The report also stated that the dubbed versions helped to increase the reach and penetration of Hollywood movies in tier 2 and tier 3 cities, where English is not widely spoken or understood. Some of the most successful Hollywood movies that were dubbed in Hindi include Avengers: Endgame, The Lion King, Spider-Man: Far From Home, and Frozen 2.
     
However, dubbing Hollywood movies in Hindi is not without its challenges and controversies. Some of the common issues faced by the dubbing industry are poor quality of voice actors, lack of synchronization between lip movements and dialogues, loss of original context and humor, and censorship by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). Moreover, some critics and audiences have argued that dubbing Hollywood movies in Hindi dilutes their artistic value and cultural identity, and that it promotes a form of cultural imperialism by imposing Western values and norms on the Indian society.
     
In conclusion, Mrityu Shikhar is a popular example of a Hollywood movie that was dubbed in Hindi for the Indian market. It is part of a long-standing trend that has both advantages and disadvantages for the film industry and the audience. While dubbing Hollywood movies in Hindi can increase their accessibility and profitability, it can also create problems of quality, authenticity, and diversity.
